# Loans & Debts Tracker
Android app that helps keep track of loans and debts.

This is my first app ever uploaded to the Play Store so I tried it to keep it as simple as possible to reach this goal quickly. Going forward, I'll add some new features and use this project as a sandbox to try out new technologies or libraries.  
  
Note that some views follow the MVP pattern and some others the MVVM pattern. This is obviously not optimal, but I did it that way to compare both of them, learn more about how to implement them and decide on one of them when starting larger projects.
